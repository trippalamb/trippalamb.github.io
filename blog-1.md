## A Chemist Programmer

When I go into an interview one of the first questions I usually get asked is, "How does someone who went to university for a degree in chemistry become a programmer?"

The short and easy and true answer is that during my first month of college I was very lucky and landed an excellent co-op computer science position at AMRDEC with some wonderful people. This company gave me time to hone my programming skills and the people gave me their time and answered every naive question I had about programming for 4 1/2 years. If I'm being honest when it came time to get a full time position after graduation, the programming positions payed more, so I took one, and the rest is history.

The other longer, more complicated, but just as true answer is that I don't think I could have ever not been a programmer. I could have been delayed longer, but I think this is one of those things that all roads would have led to for me. Programming is just the way my brain works. Often it's more natural than writing like this. I'm not a machine, I have emotion, but the way I organize information internally lends itself to programming.

```Fortran
function cleanLivingRoom(cleaningLevel)
  
  straightenUpLivingRoom()
  
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.high)
    dust()
  end if
    
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.medium)
    wipeOffSurfaces()
    vacuum()
  end if
 
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.low)
    wipeOffCoffeeTable()
    lightVacuuming()
  end if
  
end function
```

Then I often get asked, "Why not just go to school for a programming degree then?"

There is no good single answer to this question. It is a lot of different reasons, but before I get into those I want to talk about why I'm glad that I didn't. A chemistry degree is probably the greatest accomplishments of my life that I didn't really plan. I didn't plan to go to school and get a chemsitry degree. I intended to go an get a physics degree, then changed to a math degree, then a programming and biology dual major, then chemistry with a math minor, and then a math and sociolgy dual major because I read the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, but by that point I'd have been delayed graduating so I stuck with the chemistry.

As much as I would've liked to do all of the other things, I'm glad I stuck with chemistry. Chemistry shows a view of the world that just isn't recieved from anything else. It gives a basic understanding of most everything that you interact with on a daily basis. It explains why ethanol removes permanent marker but soap doesn't; why oil and water don't mix; why metal conducts electricity; and why your desk is solid while the air we breath isn't. But it also gives the ability to zoom in and out on the world around you. It explains how the properties of atoms give rise to the structure of molecules, and how the properties of molecules give rise to the structure of materials, the same materials you use every day.

This clarity and ability to zoom in and out and to see how the smaller pieces come together to make the bigger pieces is important. It is paramount to my ability to program. The ability to see the teirs and how those tiers affect the teirs above the them is such an important tool. 

Of course there are other ways to get that clarity, and a degree in programming of course would have taught me a multitude of other tools and methods that are just as important. That being said my degree in chemistry was good for me. I believe it gave me a unique perspective on software development, and just as I was always going to end up a programmer, I was also never going to be soley defined as a programmer. To me programming is a tool used in order to solve problems, and if I had only ever learned about the tool, I wouldn't have as good a grasp on the problems that need solving.
