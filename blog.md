## Extended About Me Page

When I go into an interview one of the first questions I usually get asked is, "How does someone who went to university for a degree in chemistry become a programmer?"

The short and easy and true answer is that during my first month of college I was very lucky and landed an excellent co-op computer science position at AMRDEC with some wonderful people. This company gave me time to hone my programming skills and the people gave me their time and answered every naive question I had about programming for 4 1/2 years. If I'm being honest when it came time to get a full time position after graduation, the programming positions payed more, so I took one, and the rest is history.

The other longer, more complicated, but just as true answer is that I don't think I could have ever not been a programmer. I could have been delayed longer, but I think this is one of those things that all roads would have led to for me. Programming is just the way my brain works. Often it's more natural than writing like this. I'm not a machine, I have emotion, but the way I organize information internally lends itself to programming.

```Fortran
function cleanLivingRoom(cleaningLevel)
  
  straightenUpLivingRoom()
  
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.high)
    dust()
  end if
    
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.medium)
    wipeOffSurfaces()
    vacuum()
  end if
 
  if(cleaningLevel >= cleaningLevelEnum.low)
    wipeOffCoffeeTable()
    lightVacuuming()
  end if
  
end function
```

Then I often get asked, "Why not just go to school for a programming degree then?"

There is no good single answer to this question. It is a lot of different reasons, but before I get into those I want to talk about why I'm glad that I didn't. A chemistry degree is probably the greatest accomplishments of my life that I didn't really plan. I didn't plan to go to school and get a chemsitry degree. I intended to go an get a physics degree, then changed to a math degree, then a programming and biology dual major, then chemistry with a math minor, and then a math and sociolgy dual major because I read the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, but by that point I'd have been delayed graduating so I stuck with the chemistry.

As much as I would've liked to do all of the other things, I'm glad I stuck with chemistry. Chemistry shows you a view of the world that I feel like you just don't get from anything else.
