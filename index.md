##Hello, World.

I'm a **[chemist](go to UAHuntsville degree, RCEU research, lab tech )**. 
I'm a **[programmer](go to Delta Research, Hudson Alpha, Caps, AMRDEC)**.

I like **[learning](go to skills)**. I like working on different various types of **[projects](go to personal projects)**. 
But mostly I just like solving problems. It's even better if I can create a method for someone else to solve their problem.

My main current project is creating a modular and reusable missile model for use in missile defense simulation at Delta Research Inc. [For more details or past projects go here.](go to past problems) 

I'm located in the beautiful [Rocket City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama)
