## Hello, World.

I'm a [programmer](https://trippalamb.github.io/programmer).  
I'm a [chemist](https://trippalamb.github.io/chemist).  
I'm located in the beautiful [Rocket City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama)

I like [learning](https://trippalamb.github.io/skills). I like working on personal [projects](https://github.com/trippalamb?tab=repositories). I like to [teach](https://trippalamb.github.io/tutorials) others. But mostly I like to solve problems. It's even better if I can create a method to help someone else solve their own problem.

My current problem is creating a reasonably generic and modular missile model for use in missile defense simulation at Delta Research Inc. [For more details or past problems go here.](https://trippalamb.github.io/problems) 

Well, that was the short version. If you are hooked and want to know more about me check out the above links or click [here](https://trippalamb.github.io/blog) to go to my personal blog.

I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities so send me a line at trippalamb@gmail.com.
