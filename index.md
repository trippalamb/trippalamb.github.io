## Hello, World.

I'm a [chemist](www.trippalamb.com/chemist).  
I'm a [programmer](https://trippalamb.com/programmer).

I like [learning](trippalamb.com/skils). I like working on personal [projects](trippalamb.com/projects). I like to [teach](trippalamb.com/tutorials) others. But mostly I like to solve problems. It's even better if I can create a method to help someone else solve their own problem.

My most current problem is creating a modular and reusable missile model for use in missile defense simulation at Delta Research Inc. [For more details or past problems go here.](trippalamb.com/problems) 

I'm located in the beautiful [Rocket City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama)

Well, that was the short version. If you are hooked and want to know more about me check out the above links or click [here](trippalamb.com/about) for an extended about me.

I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities so send me a line at trippalamb@gmail.com.
