## Current Problems

### Reasonably Generic and Modular Missile Model
Language: Fortran  
Owner: Delta Research  

Abstract: The current missile model only allowed for 1 missile to be run at a time due to relying on global variables and various other old Fortran practices. The methods had also become bloated due to its need to be able to represent multiple different missile types. These two main issues have been solved by rewriting the Fortran 77 code as fully object oriented Fortran 2003 code, removing all references to non-constant global variables, and utilizing object inheritance and function pointers.

Interesting Points
* I gained experience managing a project with higher level engineers than myself
* I completely redesigned the original Fortran 77 code to be rewritten as a fully Object Oriented Fortran Project
* I have gained an understanding of 
  * GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) modeling and simulation
  * Runge Kutta 4 pass integration


### Osme Programmming Language Standards and Compiler
Langauge: JS  
Owner: myself

Abstract: Aside from the desire to create a new programming language because it's cool, I often find myself frustrated at the inability for a programming language to do something natively. In using many languages over my time programming, I am occasionally frustrated that no single language handles the features I'd prefer a programming language to have. It is from these desires Osme (pronounced "Awesome") was born. Osme is intended to be a quick to write, moderately fast, and modeling and simulation focused programming language. It is intended to have few implicit styling rules leaving readability and maintainability as the programmers responsibility in their decision of which style to use. To watch the project's progress checkout [Osme Language Repo](https://github.com/trippalamb/Osme).

Interesting Points
* My skill with Regular Expressions has improved greatly due to the language parser being built around the idea of recursive regex parsing.
* By writing the documentation I have
  * Gained experience planning out a project before even touching code
  * Gained a deeper understanding of the grammar and syntaxes of programming languages in general
  * Learned to use MarkDown
