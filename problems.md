## Current Problems

### Osme Programmming Language Standards and Compiler
Langauge: JS  
Owner: myself

Abstract: Aside from the desire to create a new programming language because it's cool, I often find myself frustrated at the inability for a programming language to do something natively. In using many languages over my time programming, I am occasionally frustrated that no single language handles the features I'd prefer a programming language to have. It is from these desires Osme (pronounced "Awesome") was born. Osme is intended to be a quick to write, moderately fast, and modeling and simulation focused programming language. It is intended to have few implicit styling rules leaving readability and maintainability as the programmers responsibility in their decision of which style to use. To watch the project's progress checkout [Osme Language Repo](https://github.com/trippalamb/Osme).

Interesting Points
* My skill with Regular Expressions has improved greatly due to the language parser being built around the idea of recursive regex parsing.
* By writing the documentation I have
  * Gained experience planning out a project before even touching code
  * Gained a deeper understanding of the grammar and syntaxes of programming languages in general
  * Learned to use MarkDown
